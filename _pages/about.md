Welcome to my homepage. I am a PhD Economics student at [Pennsylvania State University](https://econ.la.psu.edu/). My research interest are in health economics and applied microeconomics. This is a version of my [CV](http://hanloong7.github.io/files/CV.pdf).

I am on the job market for the 2023â€“24 academic year. This is a draft of my [job market paper](http://hanloong7.github.io/files/JMP.pdf)!

Working Papers: 
======
[Performance Scores and Strategic Choices of Kidney Transplant Centers](http://hanloong7.github.io/files/JMP.pdf), February 2024 (Job Market Paper).

Does the threat of punishment make hospitals reduce treatments and increase patient mortality? To answer this question, I analyze the decisions of U.S. kidney transplant centers, where a 2007 reform threatened to decertify a center if the observed-expected (OE) death ratio of transplanted patients exceeds a given threshold. Using variation in distance to the OE threshold, I show that the reform reduced the probability of transplanting a patient-kidney pair. The reduction is more significant for riskier operations and low-volume centers. I find little change in aggregate patient mortality. My results suggest centers avoid transplants for performance gains, and the reform's effect is mainly redistributive. 
 
 

[Do transplant centers change strategies after poor performance?](http://hanloong7.github.io/files/3rdyearpaper.pdf), November 2023 (Neil Wallace award for Best 3rd year paper).

Medicare's conditions of participation (CoP) is a policy that requires kidney transplant centers' numbers of graft failure or patient death 1 year after transplant to fall below a cutoff. Centers that repeatedly exceed the cutoff  are flagged for poor performance and risk losing Medicare funding or certification.  I use a sharp regression discontinuity design to study centers' response to being flagged for poor performance. Contrary to the existing literature, I find no evidence to suggest that flagged centers reduce (increase) the transplant of high (low) risk kidneys or waitlist younger, less obese or non-diabetic patients.
