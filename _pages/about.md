Welcome to my homepage. I am a PhD Economics student at Pennsylvania State University. My research interest are in health economics and applied microecnomics. 

I am on the job market for the 2023â€“24 academic year. This is a version of my [CV](http://hanloong7.github.io/files/CV.pdf). Check back soon for a draft of my job market paper!
