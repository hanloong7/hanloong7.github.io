Welcome to my homepage. I am a PhD Economics student at [Pennsylvania State University](https://econ.la.psu.edu/). My research interest are in health economics and applied microecnomics. This is a version of my [CV](http://hanloong7.github.io/files/CV.pdf).

I am on the job market for the 2023â€“24 academic year. This is a draft of my [job market paper](http://hanloong7.github.io/files/JMP.pdf)!

[Performance Scores and Strategic Choices of Kidney Transplant Centers](http://hanloong7.github.io/files/JMP.pdf), November 2023 (Job Market Paper).

Does performance score affect a transplant center's strategic choices? To answer this question, we analyze the behavior of U.S. kidney transplant centers, where Medicare introduced Conditions of Participation (CoP), a performance score system, in 2007. Transplant centers are punished if their risk-adjusted death rate exceeds the threshold. Using a difference-in-difference framework, we do a before and after analysis based on the transplant center's distance from the performance threshold. We find that transplant centers reject transplants as they approach the threshold. The effect is most significant (22\% less likely to do a transplant) at the threshold. We find that transplant centers are more likely to avoid medium/high-risk transplants than low-risk transplants as we approach the threshold. Secondly, we do not see any evidence to suggest performance scores improved transplanted patients' survival rates. Thirdly, low-volume centers are more likely to reject transplants than high-volume centers even before they approach the threshold. Contrary to previous literature, our results indicate that strategic behavior among transplant centers is more widespread than previously thought.
