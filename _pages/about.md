Welcome to my homepage. I am an Assistant Research Fellow (Assistant Professor) at [Institute of Economics at Academia Sinica](https://www.econ.sinica.edu.tw/4d49b1b1-d551-4956-84a5-6bbf392d8417). I received my PhD in Economics from Pennsylvania State University, State College in 2024.

My research interests are in applied microeconomics, health economics, and industrial organization. This is a version of my [CV](http://hanloong7.github.io/files/CV.pdf).

[Performance Scores and Strategic Choices of Kidney Transplant Centers] The new draft is coming soon! 
%(http://hanloong7.github.io/files/JMP.pdf)

How does the threat of punishment affect patient mortality and hospital treatment decisions? I use administrative data to study an extensive federal program that terminates kidney transplant centers' certification for statistically significant risk-adjusted post-transplant death rates exceeding a threshold. Using policy-driven variation in the penalty incentive across centers and within-center temporal variation for identification, I implement a difference-in-difference research design and construct instrumental variables from baseline center characteristics to address potential endogeneity concerns of mean reversion. I find that the policy announcement reduced the post-transplant death rate by $16\%$. Detection of potential complications during follow-up sessions accounted for $98\%$ of the decrease in post-transplant deaths; the remainder is explained by centers more likely to reject kidney offers for patients. Contrary to the medical literature, I find no evidence of centers (i) selecting against risky transplant profiles, (ii) manipulating patients' acceptable donor criteria, or (iii) discriminating against patients during admission. Additionally, I find no evidence that the announcement increased patient waiting time or the likelihood of death from queuing. My results suggest the federal program successfully improved the patient's post-transplant experience without compromising the pre-transplant experience. 
 

[Do transplant centers change strategies after poor performance?](http://hanloong7.github.io/files/3rdyearpaper.pdf)

Medicare's conditions of participation (CoP) is a policy that requires kidney transplant centers' numbers of graft failure or patient death 1 year after transplant to fall below a cutoff. Centers that repeatedly exceed the cutoff  are flagged for poor performance and risk losing Medicare funding or certification.  I use a sharp regression discontinuity design to study centers' response to being flagged for poor performance. Contrary to the existing literature, I find no evidence to suggest that flagged centers reduce (increase) the transplant of high (low) risk kidneys or waitlist younger, less obese or non-diabetic patients.
